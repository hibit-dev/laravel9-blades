# Laravel blade structure for scalable projects
Projects tend to grow in size and level of complexity resulting in more and more files. A good base structure may help creating developer-friendly, maintainable and scalable product. Blade is a simple and powerful templating engine included with Laravel. Unlike some PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your templates. In fact, all Blade templates are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade template files use the .blade.php file extension and are typically stored in the resources/views directory.
